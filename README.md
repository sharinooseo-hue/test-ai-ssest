# AI-Assisted Software Testing Demo

This repository demonstrates a simple and explainable
AI-assisted regression test prioritization scenario.

After each commit, Jenkins runs an AI-based script that
analyzes historical test data and outputs a prioritized
list of regression tests based on risk.

The final decision of which tests to execute remains
with the human tester.

This demo is designed for academic presentation purposes.
